WWDC project

DinoGame is an educational game created by me to combine my passion for paleontology with programming and pass it on to other people. 
Each image was created by me in procreate. 
The game consists of a memory game, by completing the game you acquire points that allow you to unlock information and curiosity 
related to various groups of these extinct animals in the library.
